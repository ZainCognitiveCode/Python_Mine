# is and == are both comparison operators
a = [1,2,43]
b = [1,2,43]


print(a is b)   # exact location of object in memory
print(a == b)   # value

# jb list ka mamala hoga to dono ki locaation change ho ge lakin agar value same ha to phr ye true bhi hon gay ur location bhi same. kyunky list immutable ha.
